# Data Analytics Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Analytics Projects repository! This repository contains the code and resources for three projects that I have completed as part of my journey to master data analytics. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and predictive modeling using linear regression. Below, you will find descriptions, objectives, and links to datasets for each project.

## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

### Description
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing retail sales information. The primary goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could help retail businesses make more informed decisions.


### Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loaded and cleaned the retail sales dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand data distributions.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzed sales trends over time using time series techniques to identify seasonal patterns and trends.
- **Customer and Product Analysis:** Analyzed customer demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key segments and popular products.
- **Visualization:** Created various visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps, to effectively communicate insights.
- **Recommendations:** Provided actionable recommendations based on the EDA findings.

### Learning Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
- Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.

## Project 2: Data Cleaning

### Description
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as messy data can lead to unreliable results. This project focuses on the process of cleaning datasets by fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data.

### Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Data Integrity:** Ensured the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Dealt with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how to handle gaps.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.
- **Standardization:** Ensured consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and addressed outliers that could skew analysis or model performance.

### Learning Objectives
- Develop a solid understanding of data cleaning techniques.
- Enhance skills in handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers.
- Improve data integrity and ensure accurate analysis.

## Project 3: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

### Description
The objective of this project was to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset with relevant features. This project provided hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.


### Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Data Collection:** Obtained a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for price prediction.
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Explored the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified relevant features that contribute to the predictive model’s accuracy.
- **Model Training:** Implemented linear regression using Scikit-Learn to train the model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations to illustrate the relationship between predicted and actual values.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of linear regression.
- Gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating a predictive model.
- Develop skills in model evaluation and interpretation.
